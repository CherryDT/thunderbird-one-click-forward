# One Click Forward

Thunderbird add-on to forward emails directly through a dropdown of predefined recipients.

By David Trapp

Set the desired recipients in settings. Then, use the message toolbar button "Quick Forward" to open a dropdown with your predefined recipients and forward the email to them with one click. If you hold Shift while clicking a recipient, the compose window will stay open without actually sending the email, so you can add further changes to the email before sending it.
